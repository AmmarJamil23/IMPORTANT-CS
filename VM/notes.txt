=> A virtual machine is a program that behaves like a computer inside a computer . It givees a clean place to run code. There are two main senses of virtual machine1 
1- A hardware style virtual machine => This created a whole virtual computer with virtual CPU memory and devices. Examples are Virtual Box
2 - A language style virtual machine => This runs programs written in a special intermeditate form called bytecode. Examples are the Java VIrtual Machine and python bytecode interpreter. It is not a full full operating system. It is a layer that executes code for a language

It is just a program that pretends to be a 
computer.
We build VM's to:
1- We can run their own instructions
2- WE can study how CPU works
3- We can build languages like Python, Java.

Steps for building VM's
1- Our VM needs a place to store numbers. We call this a stack.
2- Our VM needs instructions like PUSH 5, ADD, PRINT.
3- Our VM needs to read the instructions one by one. This is called run loop.


Stack is just a list
ip means instructions pointers
Program means list of instructions
