A compiler is a program that takes human readable code and turns it inro something machines can run.
Basic flow of compiler
1- Lexer
Breaks text into small tokens like identifiers, numbers, keyboards
2- Parser
Understands structure like expressions, statements, functions.
3- AST (abstract syntax tree)
A tree that represents the meaning of the code.
4- Code generation
Turns the AST inot bytecode or machine code.


On the other hand interpreter read code and executes it directly.

FIRST STEP : LEXING
lexing is just turning characters into tokens.
Example => x = 10 + 20
Becomes 
IDENT(x)
EQUAL
NUMBER(10)
PLUS
NUMBER(20)


SECOND STEP : PARSING
parsing is turning tokens into structured tree the computer can understand.
